# Football-Who-will-win-Challenge-Data-QRT : Classification Challenge

## Context
Over the past 20 years, data analysis has become ubiquitous in sports, influencing decisions by teams, players, and bettors. Football has been at the heart of this analytics revolution.

## Objective
Predict the outcomes of football matches (home win, draw, away win) using detailed historical data of teams and players provided by Sportmonks.

## Data
- **Training**: `X_train.zip` (input data), `Y_train.csv` (match outcomes).
- **Test**: `X_test.zip`.
- **Metrics**: 25 for teams (such as 'TEAM_ATTACKS', 'TEAM_GOALS'), 52 for players, all in sum, mean, and standard deviation.

## Challenge
Develop a predictive model that can be applied to different football leagues. Benchmarks include always predicting a home win and using a gradient boosting model.

## Rules
No external data usage. Predictions are for three classes (home win, draw, away win). Accuracy is the main metric.

## Organizer
Qube Research & Technologies Group, a quantitative investment manager.
